<div style="font-size: 1.15em;">
Skript is a scripting plugin for Paper.
The syntax of Skript is close to English, but it is still not magic.
While you might succeed with experimentation for simple tasks, for anything more complex you will need some guidance.

This is Skript's documentation. You will find all supported features of the plugin here, along with some useful examples.

```applescript
command /sethome:
	permission: skript.home # Permission required for this command
	description: Set your home # Description of this command
	executable by: players # Console won't be able to run this command
	trigger: # The actual trigger/code that will run when someone do /sethome
		# Set a unique variable to sender's location
		set {home::%uuid of player%} to location of player
		# Send a message to the sender
		message "Set your home to <grey>%location of player%<reset>"

command /home:
	permission: skript.home
	description: Teleport yourself to your home
	trigger:
		# Check if that variable we used in /sethome has been set (in other words, if player ever ran /sethome)
		if {home::%uuid of player%} is not set:
			message "You have not set your home yet!"
			stop trigger # stop the code here, lines below won't run
		# Teleport the player to their home
		teleport player to {home::%uuid of player%}
		send "&aYou have been teleported."
