Welcome to the official documentation for Skript's API!

Skript comprises dozens of interworking systems, each contributing to the process that makes it tick.
It is important to understand that many parts of this API have been around since the beginning (more than 14 years ago), undergoing little to no change since then.
While these systems continue to work, their age shows.
They are intricately interwoven, and rewriting them to modern standards is no simple task, though we are making progress.
As a result, some of these systems will seem relatively modern while others are in desperate need of attention.
Regardless of status, the purpose of these pages is to provide a deeper explanation of how to best use these systems.

## Expectations
When working with Skript's API, it is strongly recommended that:
- You have a strong understanding of Java
- You have a strong understanding of using Skript
    - That is, you can comfortably write scripts
- You are not scared by old, cobweb-ridden code :)

## Organization
This documentation is organized by breaking up Skript into its major components (systems), and by breaking up each of these components into their subcomponents.
For example, *syntax* is a major component of Skript, and there are many different kinds of syntax (expressions, statements, etc.).

The cards below cover the major components covered by this documentation.
